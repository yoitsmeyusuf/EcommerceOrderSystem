## Learning Docker and RabbitMQ
In this project, I focused on learning and implementing Docker and RabbitMQ independently. The goal was to build a distributed system where different services could communicate asynchronously through a reliable messaging broker.

#### Key Technologies:

- **Docker:** Used to containerize the application and manage its services, ensuring consistency across different environments.
- **RabbitMQ:** Implemented as the messaging broker to enable seamless communication between services in an asynchronous manner.

#### Project Highlights:

- Containerized the application using Docker for ease of deployment and scalability.
- Set up RabbitMQ to handle message queues, allowing for decoupled and efficient communication between services.
- Explored best practices in using Docker Compose for multi-container applications and RabbitMQ configuration.

This project provided hands-on experience with core concepts of containerization and message-driven architecture, which are essential for building scalable and reliable distributed system
